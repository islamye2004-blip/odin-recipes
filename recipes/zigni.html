    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Zigni (Tigrinya: ዝግኒ), kaih tsebhi (Tigrinya: ቀይሕ ጸብሒ) or kai wat (Amharic: ቀይ ወጥ) is a popular Eritrean and Ethiopian stew (tsebhi or wat) made from meat, tomatoes, red onions and Berbere spices. The meat can be beef, lamb, goat, or chicken and usually placed on a plate of injera, a type of unleavened bread made from teff flour. It can be eaten for lunch or dinner. The dish requires a relatively long amount of time but not a lot of active effort to make. The traditional recipe can take as long as five to six hours to prepare. As such, it is sometimes reserved for special occasions. The Berbere spices can make the zigni spicy and give it a red color</p>
